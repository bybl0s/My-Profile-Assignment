                <u><b>Overview</b></u>
                <u><b>Overview</b></u>
                For my IT Project Idea, I have decided to make a software which helps users get better at Counter-Strike: Global Offensive by providing them with eSport professionals’ settings which can be copied by the users and help them improve. The software provides the user with CSGO eSport professional’s crosshairs, view models, resolutions, monitor refresh rate, CL BOBs, launch options, game settings, peripherals, video settings, monitor settings, setup and more. The software will also be able to save the user’s crosshair and view model and send it back to them when they need it. This software will downloadable on any windows computer<br><br>
                <u><b>Motivation</b></u>
                The motivation for this project idea boils down to the fact that I am passionate about this game. I have been playing since a young age and I remember the times when I wish that these professional settings were accessible without having to google and search for them but instead have them as accessible as a few reacts in a discord chat. In February 2021, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive reached more than a million concurrent players on Steam. The most recent CSGO match at the time of writing this, Fnatic vs Virtus.pro had more than 60,000 people watching. This proves that the eSports scene of this game is still alive and that many players would likely find value in this software. <br><br>
                <u><b>Description</b></u>
                My software will provide its users with the settings of professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive eSports players. The software will be downloadable on any Windows computer. The software will first ask for a user to register an account, and ask for their username and password. When opened by the user, it will ask for a login and password to make sure that no one can steal their valuable crosshair and view model. After logged in, the user will have an easy to use graphical interface which will help them gather the information they need to rank up in competitive Counter-Strike. The information that the users are looking for will be copyable so that the user can easily copy them and paste them into CSGO’s built in console, or so the user can paste them into google and find the product, for example a graphics card or monitor. The users can then use that crosshair that they want in game seamlessly, or find that graphics card or monitor on amazon and purchase it to improve their in-game experience. <br><br>
                The specifics of what this software will provide are: Crosshairs in the form of code that can be input into CSGO’s built in console, View models in the form of code that can be input into CSGO’s built in console, Video resolution which can be changed in the games video settings, monitor refresh rates which can be altered in the user’s monitor if their monitor allows for that, launch options which can be changed in Steam, game settings which can be changed by the user in-game, peripherals of the professionals including the gaming mouse, keyboard, headset, video settings which can be changed in the game’s settings, the specs of the professional’s computer. The software will also be able to save the user’s crosshair and view model so that they don’t lose it as it is very easy to lose a crosshair or view model. The software will also include a section where it will ask for requests where the user can submit statements which will can contain constructive criticism and can be read by me in order to help make the software a lot more helpful to the users. <br><br>
                <u><b>Tools and Technologies</b></u>
                The software will be built with Visual Studio on my personal computer at home. Visual Studio is a great pick for this type of project as it has built-in controls which makes it easier to help the user-experience as otherwise I might of made it a control-line interface which would not be favourable by the user as we are not in the 1980’s anymore. Visual Studio is also not a demanding program and I believe that this type of work can be completed on a Raspberry Pi if need be. <br><br>
                
                <u><b>Skills Required</b></u>
                The skills required for this project is experience in the .NET programming language as that is what Visual Studio runs on. Fortunately, The .NET framework is something that I have used before so that will get rid of some worries. One negative however is that I have heard MacBook’s don’t work well with Visual Studio so this project might only be able to be completed on my personal computer at home.  It will be feasible to find the skills for any problems I have using this software as google, Quora, and many other websites will help in my journey, and Visual Studio is a free software so I do not have to pay for it. <br><br>
                <u><b>Outcome</b></u>
                If the project is successful, it will positively impact the user as they will have access to CSGO professional’s settings which may help them in their journey of becoming a better player. The original problem would be solved as the user will have all of these settings one click away and won’t have to search for them individually. The user will also be able to save their cross hair and view model on this software so that they don’t lose that code, and coming from a player who played a lot of counter strike, it is very easy to lose your crosshair. <br><br>
