                I am very interested in Information Technology. It started at a young age, we always had a computer at home because my father studied computer science and loved playing Red Alert 2. I would follow the footsteps of my brother who was addicted to Counter-Strike and then I would play it a lot. My brother and I also played a lot of Minecraft, and that led to me watching content creators who played Minecraft, which led to me using Photoshop and Sony Vegas to try and make videos. My Youtuber ambitions failed but I now I have Photoshopping skills which I use to take freelancing jobs sometimes in my free time.
                I chose to come to RMIT for three reasons: It is the #1 IT university in Victoria and I want to attend a university that specializes in the area I want to commit to, my brother is also enrolled in RMIT and is taking Computer Science which gave me extra confidence, and finally the one train ride is very convenient for me, every other university would take a longer amount of time to get to.
                I expect to learn many things in my IT course at RMIT. This includes learning how to program effectively and efficiently, work with other people and complete a task / project which is functional and adds value to someone’s life. I understand, however, that this is dependent on the effort that I put in to learn. But ultimately, I would like to learn the skills that a high-paying job requires.
