                The results of these tests don’t mean that much for me to be honest. I don’t think that an online test is that effective on deciding or judging me, I feel like it is very one-dimensional and it involves a lot more situations and testing, for example, the 16personalities test concluded that I am more introverted that extroverted whilst the human metrics test picked otherwise. However, I do believe that it can get the right idea or the right impression of which type of person I am. I don’t think that these results will have that much of an influence on my behavior in a team. I don’t think I would take much of these test results into account when forming a team, but I would reflect on however the test perceives me and I would try and cancel out the negatives. For example, the 16personalities test perceived me as more introverted, I would try and be a bit more active and outgoing.
