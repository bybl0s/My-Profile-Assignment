                Hello. My name is Ahmed and I am of Lebanese descent. I migrated to Lebanon in 2006 during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War">2006 Lebanon War</a>, with the help of Turkey and Australia my family and I made it to Melbourne. I finished graduated and finished high school in 2020. I speak English and Arabic but I would like to be fluent in Arabic. I am an avid eSports gamer, I didn’t have access to a computer when I was younger but when I did I would always Counter-Strike or Minecraft, or I would photoshop / video edit for my Youtube channel which did not receive many views but It is still a dream of mine to become a content creator. An interesting fact about me is that I got the second highest rank in Valorant, and was somewhat close to getting the highest rank which would of meant I was top-500 in Oceania.
